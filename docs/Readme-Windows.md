### Known issues and limitations

1. Limitation: Wallet encryption has been temporarily disabled in ZCash due to stability problems. A corresponding issue
[#1552](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1552) has been opened by the ZCash developers. Correspondingly
wallet encryption has been temporarily disabled in the ZCash Desktop GUI Wallet.
1. Issue: the GUI wallet does not work correctly if mnzd is started with a custom data directory, like:
`mnzd -datadir=/home/data/whatever` This will be fixed in later versions.
1. Issue: GUI data tables (transactions/addresses etc.) allow copying of data via double click but also allow editing.
The latter needs to be disabled.
1. Limitation: The list of transactions does not show all outgoing ones (specifically outgoing Z address
transactions). A corresponding issue [#1438](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1438) has been opened
for the ZCash developers.
